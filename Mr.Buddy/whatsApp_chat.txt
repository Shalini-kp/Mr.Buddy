[01/11/19, 10:17:49 PM] $h@lin!: I do have a problem since childhood.. if someone says not to talk and leave.. I start feeling uncomfortable something uneasy inside.. I don’t know I told u this before. It’s hard to accept when ppl leave
[01/11/19, 10:18:53 PM] $h@lin!: Why are you doing this?  I’m not ur girlfriend to breakup and leave!!!
[01/11/19, 10:19:41 PM] $h@lin!: I had an impression friendship will be peaceful than a relationship but it also seems the same!!
[01/11/19, 10:21:05 PM] $h@lin!: I’m really not understanding what’s happening?! If u still have that feeling not to loose then say else just leave and block whatever!

[04/12/19, 2:35:26 PM] $h@lin!: Something leave
[04/12/19, 2:36:39 PM] $h@lin!: He said all the memory issues are coming from what I have worked
[04/12/19, 2:37:23 PM] $h@lin!: I had shown to Pavithra.. Max it was taking 80mb for 100+ images
[04/12/19, 2:37:45 PM] $h@lin!: He said just for 5images it is taking 200mb
[04/12/19, 2:38:24 PM] $h@lin!: I don’t know how it is possible I have checked many times then only pushed the code..
[04/12/19, 2:39:13 PM] $h@lin!: I ll check that again but he said to Ajay the app consuming more memory because of this!!!
[04/12/19, 2:39:34 PM] $h@lin!: What the fuck!
[04/12/19, 2:41:01 PM] $h@lin!: I don’t know man.. I have no problem in checking and making it work better but the way he pointed only my work though he didn’t ask!
[04/12/19, 2:42:15 PM] $h@lin!: Now I started accepting everything 🤐 though it’s not my mistake.. no use in arguing

[04/12/19, 2:52:21 PM] $h@lin!: Yes man

[04/12/19, 2:53:18 PM] Mr. Buddy: May be
[04/12/19, 2:54:18 PM] $h@lin!: Is there anything with the OS?
[04/12/19, 2:56:02 PM] $h@lin!: Because in his phone it is taking more memory so he said.. it’s not wrong but he could have shown me instead of saying to Ajay
[04/12/19, 2:56:31 PM] $h@lin!: It is working in my phone
[04/12/19, 2:56:57 PM] $h@lin!: If it is taking memory I would have fixed it but everything was working and been tested also
[04/12/19, 2:57:26 PM] $h@lin!: Suddenly... ok leave that
[04/12/19, 2:57:44 PM] $h@lin!: See for 50images it is taking 20mb

[14/12/19, 12:07:59 AM] $h@lin!: Hand shake and hug transforms the positive energy to the opposite man... that’s why professionals used to do hug or hand shake

[05/02/20, 9:54:57 PM] $h@lin!: Hybrid apps ll have limitations
[05/02/20, 9:54:58 PM] Mr. Buddy: It's built using react native
‎[05/02/20, 9:55:17 PM] $h@lin!: ‎image omitted
[05/02/20, 9:55:32 PM] $h@lin!: I also had thought so
[05/02/20, 9:56:27 PM] $h@lin!: Like we have picker views specific to android and iOS.. which may not be available in hybrid
[05/02/20, 9:57:03 PM] Mr. Buddy: The thing is for specific thing there are plugins
[05/02/20, 9:57:24 PM] Mr. Buddy: Ok
[05/02/20, 9:57:34 PM] Mr. Buddy: Amazon
[05/02/20, 9:57:41 PM] Mr. Buddy: Amazon is hybrid only ba

[05/02/20, 9:58:30 PM] Mr. Buddy: Lol
[05/02/20, 9:58:44 PM] Mr. Buddy: It's not only react native alwasy
[05/02/20, 9:58:45 PM] $h@lin!: Flutter had different designs for both iOS and android
[05/02/20, 9:58:52 PM] Mr. Buddy: And flutter you cant
[05/02/20, 9:59:22 PM] $h@lin!: It wasn’t stable before
[05/02/20, 9:59:25 PM] Mr. Buddy: Coz flutter still doesn't have lot of features which is there in current native and other hybrid framework
[05/02/20, 9:59:43 PM] $h@lin!: Yeah.. it is still under development
[05/02/20, 9:59:53 PM] Mr. Buddy: Flutter is just like intermediate you can say
[05/02/20, 10:00:00 PM] Mr. Buddy: So not a very good thing
[05/02/20, 10:00:33 PM] $h@lin!: But in the coming realease they have standard plans
[05/02/20, 10:00:45 PM] $h@lin!: More emphasis on design
[05/02/20, 10:00:49 PM] $h@lin!: I don’t know
[05/02/20, 10:02:47 PM] Mr. Buddy: Okie
[05/02/20, 10:03:24 PM] $h@lin!: U know after some years no one ll go for android and iOS
[05/02/20, 10:03:36 PM] Mr. Buddy: Why
[05/02/20, 10:03:52 PM] $h@lin!: React native is very popular now
[05/02/20, 10:04:10 PM] Mr. Buddy: That's for less complex task
[05/02/20, 10:04:11 PM] $h@lin!: And have seen so many companies offering more for flutter too
[05/02/20, 10:05:33 PM] Mr. Buddy: No man by the time hybreed apps develop that much native programing will be already 10 years ahead
[05/02/20, 10:05:57 PM] Mr. Buddy: This is truth
[05/02/20, 10:06:44 PM] Mr. Buddy: If you see mwc videos you will know

[03/04/20, 11:33:09 PM] Mr. Buddy: But still thank u fr it gratitude
[03/04/20, 11:33:12 PM] $h@lin!: See after so long days because Ajay I talked with him
[03/04/20, 11:33:23 PM] $h@lin!: I couldn’t feel anything
[03/04/20, 11:33:33 PM] $h@lin!: No love nothing
[03/04/20, 11:33:37 PM] $h@lin!: Everything is gone
[03/04/20, 11:33:52 PM] $h@lin!: And decided to stay friends as before
[03/04/20, 11:34:09 PM] $h@lin!: And love was not a thing for us may be
[03/04/20, 11:34:22 PM] $h@lin!: See love just fades away.. it’s not tru
[03/04/20, 11:34:25 PM] $h@lin!: I dnt know
[03/04/20, 11:34:50 PM] $h@lin!: I feel nothing about anyone now and it feels chilled😂 and relaxed
[03/04/20, 11:34:52 PM] Mr. Buddy: Love it's should come in flow
[03/04/20, 11:35:17 PM] $h@lin!: And it should be from both and sustain for whatever it happens
[03/04/20, 11:35:28 PM] $h@lin!: It shouldn’t break for anything
[03/04/20, 11:35:37 PM] Mr. Buddy: See that's the problem
[03/04/20, 11:35:50 PM] $h@lin!: How to which is true and which is just attraction
[03/04/20, 11:36:11 PM] Mr. Buddy: You just have to accept everything and stay in limit
[03/04/20, 11:36:13 PM] Mr. Buddy: That's all
[03/04/20, 11:36:22 PM] $h@lin!: True
[03/04/20, 11:36:37 PM] $h@lin!: Shouldn’t attach to anyone
[03/04/20, 11:36:50 PM] Mr. Buddy: So even if it breaks up after sometime you'll forget easily
[03/04/20, 11:36:53 PM] $h@lin!: That’s what leads to some stupid feelings
[03/04/20, 11:37:11 PM] Mr. Buddy: We only should control
[03/04/20, 11:37:13 PM] $h@lin!: Actually first when u said I couldn’t believe
[03/04/20, 11:37:24 PM] $h@lin!: Because I thought can’t live without him
[03/04/20, 11:37:29 PM] Mr. Buddy: See that depends on ppl
[03/04/20, 11:37:33 PM] $h@lin!: But eventually it changed
[03/04/20, 11:38:07 PM] $h@lin!: Now even if he talks I dnt feel anything
[03/04/20, 11:38:12 PM] Mr. Buddy: If some one gets love just bcz they are close with anyone, after sometime if someone else try to be close with them they feel that same thing for them also
[03/04/20, 11:38:43 PM] $h@lin!: How can?
[03/04/20, 11:38:59 PM] Mr. Buddy: So anything happens we should not just rush and reveal everything, just have to wait patiently and then decide
[03/04/20, 11:39:05 PM] $h@lin!: If u are committed to someone u shouldn’t change ur feelings and get close to someone
[03/04/20, 11:39:11 PM] $h@lin!: If u are single then it’s fine
[03/04/20, 11:39:38 PM] Mr. Buddy: See that based on ppl
[03/04/20, 11:39:39 PM] $h@lin!: Talking like a matured kid🤭 .. but true facts
[03/04/20, 11:39:59 PM] $h@lin!: U can love two girls at a time😳
[03/04/20, 11:40:23 PM] Mr. Buddy: See they will know that they should not do it, but you always can't hold feelings, that's the problem
[03/04/20, 11:40:39 PM] Mr. Buddy: So I think it's natural
[03/04/20, 11:40:44 PM] $h@lin!: Yeah
[03/04/20, 11:40:56 PM] $h@lin!: But why to control ... let it in flow
[03/04/20, 11:40:58 PM] Mr. Buddy: Those kind of ppl better to stay single
[03/04/20, 11:40:59 PM] $h@lin!: 😂
[03/04/20, 11:41:40 PM] $h@lin!: It means u can’t hold ur feelings so u wnT to stay single?😂
[03/04/20, 11:42:24 PM] $h@lin!: And I dnt think if u get close u ll have feelings for each other... I ll not happen with everyone
[03/04/20, 11:42:35 PM] $h@lin!: Friends also ll be close
[03/04/20, 11:42:42 PM] Mr. Buddy: It will happen man
[03/04/20, 11:43:23 PM] $h@lin!: Hey how
[03/04/20, 11:44:02 PM] $h@lin!: Then friends can’t stay friends forever?!
[03/04/20, 11:44:32 PM] $h@lin!: I think it’s up to to them! And u can’t feel the attraction with everyone u get close🧐
[03/04/20, 11:45:08 PM] Mr. Buddy: Hmm
[03/04/20, 11:47:23 PM] $h@lin!: Watch ae dil hai Mushkil

[16/04/20, 11:59:12 AM] $h@lin!: Toodles is another way to say goodbye to someone. While it's normally used in a polite or neutral manner, it can also be used as an insult as well. Typically after an argument online, toodles will be told to the supposed “loser” of the argument as a form of mockery.

[13/05/20, 8:14:25 PM] $h@lin!: I was happy for a moment
[13/05/20, 8:14:27 PM] Mr. Buddy: Then normal stats only
[13/05/20, 8:14:29 PM] $h@lin!: 🥺
[13/05/20, 8:15:08 PM] $h@lin!: I’m thinking to shift to react native
[13/05/20, 8:15:32 PM] Mr. Buddy: Why man
[13/05/20, 8:15:37 PM] $h@lin!: can be used in  both android and iOS
[13/05/20, 8:15:54 PM] Mr. Buddy: But react native is web based app na
[13/05/20, 8:15:59 PM] $h@lin!: Mobile application.. I can cover all platforms
[13/05/20, 8:16:07 PM] $h@lin!: Yes
[13/05/20, 8:16:26 PM] Mr. Buddy: If some one like me chooses it it's ok for me
[13/05/20, 8:16:27 PM] $h@lin!: But when I see Myntra.. it is so stable
[13/05/20, 8:16:32 PM] $h@lin!: And amazon prime also
[13/05/20, 8:16:49 PM] Mr. Buddy: But fir you if you switch from native to web based app it's like backward going
[13/05/20, 8:17:00 PM] $h@lin!: 🤔
[13/05/20, 8:17:21 PM] Mr. Buddy: You should go like golang or python
[13/05/20, 8:17:23 PM] Mr. Buddy: Like that
[13/05/20, 8:17:29 PM] $h@lin!: I thought it ll be a another approach for mobile development
[13/05/20, 8:17:43 PM] Mr. Buddy: Or you should learn android native app
[13/05/20, 8:17:50 PM] $h@lin!: Python I know somehow... golang 🤔 I dnt
[13/05/20, 8:18:02 PM] $h@lin!: For that have to learn java know
[13/05/20, 8:18:22 PM] Mr. Buddy: Java is like c# only man
[13/05/20, 8:18:38 PM] $h@lin!: I don’t know c# also
[13/05/20, 8:18:52 PM] Mr. Buddy: iOS is c# na
[13/05/20, 8:18:56 PM] $h@lin!: No
[13/05/20, 8:18:58 PM] $h@lin!: Swift
[13/05/20, 8:19:04 PM] $h@lin!: It’s like python
[13/05/20, 8:19:09 PM] $h@lin!: Almost same
[13/05/20, 8:19:18 PM] Mr. Buddy: They say something like objective c??
[13/05/20, 8:19:20 PM] Mr. Buddy: No???
[13/05/20, 8:19:27 PM] $h@lin!: That is old language
[13/05/20, 8:19:33 PM] Mr. Buddy: Ohwww ok
[13/05/20, 8:19:38 PM] $h@lin!: Before swift they were using objective C
[13/05/20, 8:19:50 PM] $h@lin!: They release new versions every year
[13/05/20, 8:19:55 PM] Mr. Buddy: Then learn kotlin easier than javs
[13/05/20, 8:20:06 PM] Mr. Buddy: More resdsblity
[13/05/20, 8:20:13 PM] $h@lin!: Now swift also becoming old and they are going introduce new frameworks over it
[13/05/20, 8:20:29 PM] $h@lin!: 🤔
[13/05/20, 8:20:33 PM] Mr. Buddy: Kotlin you can choose na
[13/05/20, 8:20:49 PM] Mr. Buddy: Now for Android you can use Java or kotlin
[13/05/20, 8:21:03 PM] $h@lin!: I was just thinking for ios I have to build separate app and for android separate
[13/05/20, 8:21:22 PM] $h@lin!: So in react I can finish everything in one code base know😂
[13/05/20, 8:21:37 PM] Mr. Buddy: Ha you know javascript??;
[13/05/20, 8:21:38 PM] $h@lin!: Yeah they have already updated to Kotlin
[13/05/20, 8:21:46 PM] $h@lin!: Only basics
[13/05/20, 8:22:00 PM] Mr. Buddy: Okie
[13/05/20, 8:22:08 PM] $h@lin!: Will see🤔
[13/05/20, 8:22:19 PM] $h@lin!: While thinking only I finish everything 👀
[13/05/20, 8:22:43 PM] Mr. Buddy: I dunno, I tot since you know native app development , it will be easy for you to android
[13/05/20, 8:22:55 PM] $h@lin!: Just sit and do nothing but think everything which I’m not going to do tight now
[13/05/20, 8:23:15 PM] $h@lin!: Android also have similar way of development
[13/05/20, 8:23:23 PM] Mr. Buddy: I dunno
[13/05/20, 8:23:29 PM] $h@lin!: It would be easy.. but java is huge know
[13/05/20, 8:23:39 PM] $h@lin!: When it comes to UI
[13/05/20, 8:23:47 PM] Mr. Buddy: Java is not huge
[13/05/20, 8:23:57 PM] $h@lin!: But they dnt have storyboards they have to write xml for that
[13/05/20, 8:24:01 PM] Mr. Buddy: I learnt java after joining here only
[13/05/20, 8:24:10 PM] $h@lin!: I know java
[13/05/20, 8:24:15 PM] Mr. Buddy: I knew only c#
[13/05/20, 8:24:34 PM] $h@lin!: But I dnt like to work
[13/05/20, 8:24:50 PM] Mr. Buddy: Swift is not oops??!
[13/05/20, 8:24:52 PM] $h@lin!: U have to type of all public blah blah
[13/05/20, 8:24:57 PM] $h@lin!: Yes it is
[13/05/20, 8:24:58 PM] Mr. Buddy: No
[13/05/20, 8:25:16 PM] $h@lin!: It is cool like python
[13/05/20, 8:25:41 PM] $h@lin!: Only two types var and let
[13/05/20, 8:25:44 PM] Mr. Buddy: May be you just say bcz of that main function
[13/05/20, 8:25:48 PM] $h@lin!: But not completely like python
[13/05/20, 8:25:57 PM] $h@lin!: We have to follow few steps
[13/05/20, 8:26:06 PM] $h@lin!: Exactly 😂
[13/05/20, 8:26:14 PM] $h@lin!: I really dnt like that line
[13/05/20, 8:26:15 PM] Mr. Buddy: Public static void main () {}
[13/05/20, 8:26:18 PM] $h@lin!: I don’t know why
[13/05/20, 8:26:23 PM] $h@lin!: Yeah
[13/05/20, 8:26:29 PM] Mr. Buddy: That now a days in ide
[13/05/20, 8:26:30 PM] $h@lin!: And that interface also
[13/05/20, 8:26:45 PM] Mr. Buddy: If you just type main and click tab, it will create automatically
[13/05/20, 8:27:05 PM] Mr. Buddy: Xcode doesn't have auto suggestion??!
[13/05/20, 8:27:10 PM] $h@lin!: It has
[13/05/20, 8:27:20 PM] $h@lin!: That’s why most of the time I dnt google
[13/05/20, 8:27:33 PM] Mr. Buddy: Java is very easy
[13/05/20, 8:27:34 PM] $h@lin!: I simply try all depended function
[13/05/20, 8:27:50 PM] Mr. Buddy: But most of the ios developer doesn't like java and lines python
[13/05/20, 8:28:05 PM] $h@lin!: Yes it is but I feel we have to write too much of code and follow guidelines
[13/05/20, 8:28:26 PM] $h@lin!: Actually the ppl who likes python doesn’t like java
[13/05/20, 8:28:37 PM] $h@lin!: Visa versa
‎[13/05/20, 8:30:03 PM] Mr. Buddy: ‎image omitted
[13/05/20, 8:30:06 PM] $h@lin!: U like python ?
‎[13/05/20, 8:30:12 PM] Mr. Buddy: ‎image omitted
[13/05/20, 8:30:15 PM] Mr. Buddy: Ha python I like
[13/05/20, 8:30:27 PM] Mr. Buddy: Bcz of this I think u like swift
[13/05/20, 8:30:34 PM] $h@lin!: Actually lazy ppl like python
[13/05/20, 8:30:46 PM] $h@lin!: Now a days kids only can write python programs
[13/05/20, 8:31:11 PM] $h@lin!: Yes😂
[13/05/20, 8:31:17 PM] Mr. Buddy: Ha
[13/05/20, 8:31:26 PM] $h@lin!: No for this also
[13/05/20, 8:31:31 PM] Mr. Buddy: But however when u creafe app you create class na??
[13/05/20, 8:31:35 PM] $h@lin!: We have to write it inside the class
[13/05/20, 8:31:51 PM] $h@lin!: Every view itself a class
[13/05/20, 8:31:56 PM] Mr. Buddy: Ha
[13/05/20, 8:32:06 PM] $h@lin!: Everything we write inside a class
[13/05/20, 8:32:20 PM] Mr. Buddy: See java is old language that's y that syntx is still maintained
[13/05/20, 8:32:28 PM] Mr. Buddy: Thats y android xame up with kotlin
[13/05/20, 8:32:34 PM] $h@lin!: This is just an example if u do in playground but if u are doing in project it ll be inside class
‎[13/05/20, 8:33:06 PM] Mr. Buddy: ‎image omitted
[13/05/20, 8:33:09 PM] $h@lin!: Yeah simplified version of java
[13/05/20, 8:33:22 PM] $h@lin!: Cool
[13/05/20, 8:33:38 PM] Mr. Buddy: Println also not required print is enough
[13/05/20, 8:34:15 PM] $h@lin!: For us that main function ll not be there but by default there ll be overridden function
[13/05/20, 8:34:20 PM] $h@lin!: For rendering UI
[13/05/20, 8:34:38 PM] Mr. Buddy: Ok
[13/05/20, 8:35:39 PM] $h@lin!: Once u create a file u ll have one function by default
[13/05/20, 8:35:54 PM] $h@lin!: U can override other functions if u want
[13/05/20, 8:35:59 PM] $h@lin!: U can learn in a day
[13/05/20, 8:36:04 PM] $h@lin!: It’s too easy
[13/05/20, 8:36:27 PM] Mr. Buddy: Haaa

[13/05/20, 8:39:50 PM] Mr. Buddy: No I think one more is node I guess
[13/05/20, 8:40:02 PM] $h@lin!: Just with JavaScript?

[13/05/20, 8:43:27 PM] $h@lin!: For network connection
[13/05/20, 8:43:32 PM] Mr. Buddy: Frameworks no need to write code for that, they have prebuilt connection settings just have to fill data
[13/05/20, 8:43:49 PM] $h@lin!: 😯
[13/05/20, 8:44:03 PM] Mr. Buddy: Only for querry we have to write now
[13/05/20, 8:44:09 PM] $h@lin!: To write a program only is easy because of frameworks and IDEs
[13/05/20, 8:44:13 PM] Mr. Buddy: That also some functions are there

[16/05/20, 1:15:02 PM] Mr. Buddy: Ohwwww
[16/05/20, 1:15:02 PM] $h@lin!: They still use SQLite for other things I guess

[16/05/20, 1:16:44 PM] Mr. Buddy: Okieee

[16/05/20, 1:18:55 PM] $h@lin!: U know he was not dependent on anyone.. though he was in hospital even to go washroom he was not taking anyone help. And for his funeral he had deposited 3lacs and for living also he was getting pension.. I learnt we shouldn’t trouble or bother anyone and we only have to live our life.
[16/05/20, 1:18:55 PM] $h@lin!: We shouldn’t take help from others but we have to help others how much we can
[16/05/20, 1:20:02 PM] $h@lin!: This is what I understood from past two days
[16/05/20, 1:22:45 PM] Mr. Buddy: Hmmmm

[16/05/20, 1:26:15 PM] $h@lin!: I felt it so well taught to take care of ourself and think how we shouldn’t trouble others after death also
[16/05/20, 1:26:46 PM] Mr. Buddy: 🤔🤔🤔🤔

[23/05/20, 11:59:02 PM] $h@lin!: Then why can’t friends stay together the whole life 🤔

[24/05/20, 12:00:12 AM] $h@lin!: That’s why I’m saying
[24/05/20, 12:00:33 AM] $h@lin!: Like this we can stay with friends only the whole life🤔
[24/05/20, 12:00:48 AM] $h@lin!: Is it possible
[24/05/20, 12:01:15 AM] Mr. Buddy: No
[24/05/20, 12:01:22 AM] $h@lin!: Without having bad feelings... to live together as friends 🤔
[24/05/20, 12:01:40 AM] $h@lin!: Why
[24/05/20, 12:02:42 AM] $h@lin!: There are normal couples, gays, lesbians... it’s just the same but different purpose
[24/05/20, 12:06:12 AM] Mr. Buddy: No
[24/05/20, 12:07:31 AM] $h@lin!: Why

[24/05/20, 12:09:13 AM] Mr. Buddy: How is possible
[24/05/20, 12:13:40 AM] $h@lin!: I don’t know
[24/05/20, 12:14:02 AM] $h@lin!: Just like that
[24/05/20, 12:14:41 AM] $h@lin!: Get up, have food, go to office, come back, have food and sleep
[24/05/20, 12:14:58 AM] $h@lin!: That’s all we do🤔
[24/05/20, 12:15:52 AM] Mr. Buddy: No
[24/05/20, 12:16:14 AM] $h@lin!: Then
[24/05/20, 12:20:02 AM] Mr. Buddy: I dunno I'm not sure
[24/05/20, 12:22:48 AM] $h@lin!: I don’t know.. just came to mind
[24/05/20, 12:24:29 AM] $h@lin!: Marriage is something special.. if we marry we should to the fullest.  Else we shouldn’t for sake of doing something right
[24/05/20, 12:25:41 AM] $h@lin!: It shouldn’t be just for lust! And having kids. It should be filled with purity of love, happiness and peace✌️
[24/05/20, 12:27:18 AM] $h@lin!: So just a thought we feel happy and satisfied with ppl around.. say a friend(gender doesn’t matter) can stay together the whole life🤔
[24/05/20, 12:35:31 AM] Mr. Buddy: No man how is it possible
[24/05/20, 12:37:35 AM] $h@lin!: Yeah it’s not possible
[24/05/20, 12:37:58 AM] $h@lin!: That’s why I was still thinking 🤣
[24/05/20, 12:38:44 AM] $h@lin!: May be it’s possible.. it depends on ppl
[24/05/20, 12:45:16 AM] $h@lin!: Actually my friend who is getting married used to say if we dnt get married we ll stay together the whole life
[24/05/20, 12:46:35 AM] $h@lin!: If two ppl are so close that they can’t live without each other.. if someone has that attachment can stay together the whole life.. that’s not difficult and it’s possible
[24/05/20, 12:47:13 AM] $h@lin!: So was thinking 🙃 anyway we weren’t that close
[24/05/20, 12:49:22 AM] Mr. Buddy: Haaaaa

[27/05/20, 3:09:05 PM] $h@lin!: Hi Praveeni,

As a developer we are using qa(testing) builds also and sometimes we missed to mark attendance at 10 am but if you will check Pavithra at 10:30 daily we are attending standup meetings and I think same she is also sharing daily.
One more thing as I am working remotely I always be available before 10am as well and working after 7 pm also, you can confirm with my team lead.
From last month we worked after office hours also(sometimes till 1am and 2 am) and made releases on time and still we are working with same enthusiasm.

You will see my attendance history you can check I am marking attendance regularly from day 1.

Thanks
[27/05/20, 3:09:13 PM] $h@lin!: This is Ashutosh reply😂
[27/05/20, 3:09:31 PM] $h@lin!: Due to storage of devices for development, I have been using the QA build for development/testing so there was delay in marking attendance. I have been working late nights till morning say more than 3am. Kindly check with team lead if you have any queries.
[27/05/20, 3:09:36 PM] $h@lin!: I said this

[27/05/20, 3:24:44 PM] $h@lin!: Hi Shalini,



There is no question on your commitment to work. We all know that how much dedicated you are to the work. As you can see, the instructions shared were mentioned as mandatory guideline. In case, if any statutory audit happens,  and If there is any deviation then HR team will be answerable to the them. If there is any issue to follow the guideline, like now you mentioned that you have QA build installed, please report to HR team through email, which remains for their record. And it is your, mine and everyone’s responsibility to adhere with the company’s policies, so let’s stay together in the process of building this system.
[27/05/20, 3:24:55 PM] $h@lin!: See what Preethi sent

Yes I do understand, I will adhere to the company policy and make sure I mark the attendance at the stipulated time. If any deviation because of using personal phone for developmental purpose, I will drop a mail either the same day or before your monthly attendance calculation day.

Thanks and Regards,

[10/06/20, 11:41:47 PM] Mr. Buddy: But the thing is issue only when I have concirrency
[10/06/20, 11:42:08 PM] Mr. Buddy: If I run one, two threads it will be fine
[10/06/20, 11:42:17 PM] $h@lin!: Only with concurrency!
[10/06/20, 11:42:39 PM] Mr. Buddy: Ha
[10/06/20, 11:42:42 PM] $h@lin!: May be for more number of threads it’s consider like array of threads
[10/06/20, 11:42:52 PM] $h@lin!: May be that’s why the type has changed
[10/06/20, 11:43:02 PM] $h@lin!: Can’t u check the type while running ?
[10/06/20, 11:43:12 PM] Mr. Buddy: So if I run concurrently 60% passes 40% throws this exception
[10/06/20, 11:43:19 PM] Mr. Buddy: Ha I can
[10/06/20, 11:43:26 PM] Mr. Buddy: But it will make the script heavy

[10/06/20, 11:43:37 PM] $h@lin!: Yeah
[10/06/20, 11:43:57 PM] $h@lin!: But either way u have to change its type

[10/06/20, 11:44:11 PM] $h@lin!: 🤔
[10/06/20, 11:45:05 PM] $h@lin!: Before it starts u can’t forcefully change it type and run?
[10/06/20, 11:45:29 PM] Mr. Buddy: Haaa
[10/06/20, 11:45:33 PM] Mr. Buddy: That only I'm trying
[10/06/20, 11:45:34 PM] $h@lin!: If that type changes dynamically then it ll not work

[16/06/20, 1:07:24 PM] $h@lin!: Something is fishy
[16/06/20, 1:08:17 PM] $h@lin!: macOS Catalina 10.15.5 introduces battery health management in the Energy Saver settings for notebooks, an option to control automatic prominence of video tiles on Group FaceTime calls, and controls to fine-tune the built-in calibration of your Pro Display XDR. The update also improves the stability, reliability, and security of your Mac.

Battery Health Management
• Battery health management to help maximize battery lifespan for Mac notebooks
• Energy Saver preference pane now displays battery condition and recommends if the battery needs to be serviced
• Option to disable battery health management

[17/06/20, 2:58:41 PM] $h@lin!: Hi,

This is to inform that I have updated macOS to latest macOS Catalina 10.15.5, after the update facing problem with the battery. It works only if I connected to the power adapter.

In the latest update they have released with the feature to safe the battery life: battery health management, probably for our laptop model it’s not compatible. I tried available solution but didn’t work.

The solution would be to downgrade the OS or to have check up with the battery in service centre if possible. For now I can work with steady power connection. If possible, I will try to fix it.

Thanks and Regards,

That moment I got so angry that he never cared me like that! And for her he is saying like that!... that day he scolded I dnt know the value of friendship. Now i understand .. see though she was married (that too hers is love marriage) the friendship, care was still the same 😊🤗 friendship ll be way stronger than relationship.

[10/07/20, 10:09:49 PM] Mr. Buddy: In bible it says god created human in his own image
[10/07/20, 10:10:14 PM] Mr. Buddy: But after some stuffs ppl will commit sin
[10/07/20, 10:10:31 PM] Mr. Buddy: So according to biblical theory wages of sin is death
[10/07/20, 10:10:49 PM] Mr. Buddy: So since human has committed sin , he has to die to pay for it
[10/07/20, 10:11:19 PM] Mr. Buddy: So to remove that, jesus will take himself on behalf of alll human beings and die on the cross
[10/07/20, 10:11:35 PM] Mr. Buddy: So this proves god is so loving and just

[10/07/20, 10:12:32 PM] $h@lin!: 😥
[10/07/20, 10:12:46 PM] Mr. Buddy: But to escape it, he is just  influening humans in the earth to become bad amd join him

[10/07/20, 10:13:14 PM] $h@lin!: Oh for ppl he did
[10/07/20, 10:13:16 PM] Mr. Buddy: So since god is loving God seeing that many people die, god may change  his mind

[10/07/20, 10:17:24 PM] Mr. Buddy: One and half year I guess
[10/07/20, 10:17:33 PM] Mr. Buddy: And then he didn't die
